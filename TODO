Startup
-------
 * read all config files
 * read "flash" pickle
 * collect system information
 * label it all as "reading the flash"
 * parse a ~/.openpixrc file for preferences
 * load previous command line history

Flash Drive
-----------
 * a pickle
 * stores all non-system informtion when "write mem" is called
 * update "show" command to support 

Command Line Completion
-----------------------
 * create a class modeled after rlcompleter.Complete
 * write global_matches to return the list of all possible commands
 * devise a means of getting a list of all possible commads
 * write attr_matches to use spaces (e.g., subcommands) instead of dots (for
   python modules, etc.)
 * set the readline completer to the overridden complete method 
 * the implementation of the help system hinges upon this

Command Line History
--------------------
 * add support for saving history (to pickle?)

Show Command
-------------
 * "show ?" should display a list of legal subcommands

System Commads
--------------

OpenPIX ping and traceroute command will depend on the underly os to esecute
the respective binaries of the same name. In addition, firewall commands will
need to be executed against the the system binary that makes the changes to the
running firewall software (e.g., pfctl for packet filter on OpenBSD). As such,
a proper and efficient means of executing shell commands is needed. There are
reported bugs with the subprocess module, so that needs to be investigated. We
need the solution that is most bug-free and least memory-consumptive.

Firewall Control
----------------

Actual control of the firewall will be made via system calls (see above).
Different firewall/packet filtering software will have different means of
accomplishing this. OpenPIX needs to support the ability to add an arbitrary
number of such potential backends:
 * a configuration option in .openpixrc for setting the desired backend
 * an "enable" (privileged mode) command for setting the backend
 * logic in the appropriate openpix.commands.*.*._doCommand methods that ensure
   that the configured backend is the one aginst which commands are being
   executed
 * an openpix.system subpackage:
    - openpix.system.call - code for executing system calls
    - openpix.system.backends.pf, iptables, ipfw, etc. - code for different
      backends
